ALL python jupyter notebook\
The data provided is of 5 years worth of stock values from 2018-2022.\
Your job is to analyze and make models to predict this stock. Try as many models as possible.
 
#Data Dictionary:-\
Date: Date at which a particular value of stock was recorded.\
Open:: The value at which stock was opened at that day.\
High:: Highest value of the stock during the day.\
Low:: Lowest value of the stock during the day.\
Close:: The day end's value of the stock, the closing value.\
Adj Close:: The adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions.\
Volume:: Volume in the stock market means the total number of shares traded in a specified time frame. This would include every share bought and sold during the time period in review.
